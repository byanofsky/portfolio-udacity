# portfolio-udacity
This is my Portfolio Project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Program.

Built upon Bootstrap framework. Uses Grunt for build tasks.

## Installation

Download files to a directory and run `grunt` within main directory where package.json is located to install Grunt plugins.

See ["Working with an existing Grunt project"](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#working-with-an-existing-grunt-project).

The `src/` directory contains all unminified versions of HTML and CSS, as well as original images.

The `dist/` directory contains the minified versions of HTML and CSS, as well as optimized images (1x and 2x resolutions).

Changes to the `src/` directory will update `dist/` after running `grunt`.

View site by opening `dist/index.html`.
